# Proof of Performance - Programming II

**University**: Deggendorf Institute of Technology
**Semester**: Summer 2024  

## Task 1 - Tic Tac Toe

### Overview
Complete Task 1 to pass the proof of performance (**Leistungsnachweis**). This task involves implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players on the command line.

### Rules
- Use Python for the implementation.
- Write a report of about 4 pages.
- Groups of up to 3 students can make a joint submission.
- Submission must include the names and student IDs of all group members.
- Submit your report (as PDF) and code (as ZIP) via iLearn.

### Bonus Task
Successful completion of Task 2 carries a 10% bonus for the exam. The same rules as for Task 1 apply, except that you do not have to write a report.

## Task Details

### Implementation Requirements
- Follow authentic object-oriented programming practices.
- Design your software using the Model View Controller (MVC) or Model View Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern.
- Implement features to save the game state to a file and load the game state when opening the game.
- Add a second mode to play against a game AI using your own heuristics or the minimax algorithm.
- Write unit tests for your business logic, including the game AI, achieving at least 90% line coverage.
- Adhere to the Python PEP8 coding style guide and use a linter to ensure compliance.
- Use https://mygit.th-deg.de to manage the codebase.

### Additional Notes
All listed requirements are mandatory and graded separately. Failure to meet any requirement will result in failing the proof of performance. AI assistants are prohibited.
